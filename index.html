            <h2 class="cardTitle">Automated network management</h2>
            <h3>The IETF is working on standards for automated network management which, as the name implies, aims to
                improve and make more efficient management of networks as they continue to increase in size and
                complexity.</h3>
            <p>As the number and diversity of devices that make up the individual networks that comprise the Internet
                continue to grow, automating routine network management tasks becomes ever-more important. Data
                modeling-driven management applies the YANG modeling language to formally describe data sources and
                APIs. Importantly, work within the IETF to produce data models, using its consensus-based approach to
                develop open standards, helps facilitate cross-industry collaboration and coordination. A key to
                automated network management is the YANG data modeling language used to model configuration and state
                data manipulated by the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) and RESTCONF which were developed
                within the IETF.

                Yet the key measure of success is deployment of the work undertaken within the IETF. Efforts to advance
                YANG development and the tools needed to support it are also a consistent presence at IETF Hackathons.
                IETF participants have undertaken education efforts around protocols such as RESTCONF and NETCONF, and
                helped develop tools, such as the YANG Catalog, to support its work.

                Looking further ahead, the IETF is also standardizing protocols for autonomic networking, which aims to
                enable networks to be self-managing, including self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing, and
                self-protection. If successful, autonomic networking will greatly simplify routine network management
                tasks. Research on automated network management in the Internet Research Task Force resulted in RFC7575
                and RFC7576, and led to the creation of the IETF ANIMA working group, which is in the process of
                defining protocols for autonomic network infrastructure.</p>

            <h2 class="cardTitle">Making the Web Accessible</h2>
            <h3>Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to lead the Web
                to its full potential.</h3>
            <p>W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented
                potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that
                are available on any device. Although the boundaries of the platform continue to evolve, industry
                leaders speak nearly in unison about how HTML5 will be the cornerstone for this platform. But the full
                strength of the platform relies on many more technologies that W3C and its partners are creating,
                including CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and a variety of APIs.

                W3C develops these technical specifications and guidelines through a process designed to maximize
                consensus about the content of a technical report, to ensure high technical and editorial quality, and
                to earn endorsement by W3C and the broader community.</p>

            <h2 class="cardTitle">ICANN around the World</h2>
            <h3>ICANN's mission is to help ensure a stable, secure, and unified global Internet. To reach another person
                on the Internet, you need to type an address – a name or a number – into your computer or other device.
                That address must be unique so computers know where to find each other. ICANN helps coordinate and
                support these unique identifiers across the world.</h3>
            <p>In more technical terms, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) helps coordinate
                the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions, which are key technical services critical to
                the continued operations of the Internet's underlying address book, the Domain Name System (DNS). The
                IANA functions include: (1) the coordination of the assignment of technical protocol parameters
                including the management of the address and routing parameter area (ARPA) top-level domain; (2) the
                administration of certain responsibilities associated with Internet DNS root zone management such as
                generic (gTLD) and country code (ccTLD) Top-Level Domains; (3) the allocation of Internet numbering
                resources; and (4) other services.</p>
